<p>Alluvial/Sankey plots which are often used for assessing patterns in patient flow, e.g., consecutively received treatments. The function ‘vr_alluvial_plot’ is wrapper based on easyalluvial and parcats packages, to facilitate this task. Short tutorial below.</p>
<pre><code>#&gt; Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 3.6.3
#&gt; 
#&gt; Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

#&gt; Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.6.3</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>To use this function we need to have data, which contain variables: patients ids, treatments names and lines of therapy numbers. Let’s simulate such dataset.</p>

<p>When we have any dataset, minimally what we need to pass to function in parameters are variable names corresponding to patients ids, treatments names and lines of therapy numbers like that:</p>

<p>If you will use our package to work with Flatiron database, there is good information for you. You do not need to pass variable names because names existing in Flatiron database are taken as default, it means: (“PatientID”, “LineName”, “LineNumber”). In this case you can simply do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/vr_alluvial_plot.html">vr_alluvial_plot</a></span>(dataset)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Except discussed already parameters there are other important parameters. Here are all of them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" title="1"><span class="co">#' @param n_common Number of most common lines of therapy presented in alluvial plot, Default: 2 </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" title="2"><span class="co">#' @param title plot title, Default: NULL</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" title="3"><span class="co">#' @param interactive, interactive plot, Default: FALSE</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" title="4"><span class="co">#' @param N_unit, Default: 'patients' </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-5" title="5"><span class="co">#' @param data_source data source name, Default: 'Flatiron'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-6" title="6"><span class="co">#' @param fill_by one_of(c('first_variable', 'last_variable', 'all_flows', 'values')), Default: 'first_variable'</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-7" title="7"><span class="co">#' @param col_vector_flow HEX color values for flows, Default: easyalluvial::palette_filter( greys = F)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-8" title="8"><span class="co">#' @param col_vector_value HEX color values  for y levels/values, Default:RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, 'Blues')[c(3,6,4,7,5,8)]</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-9" title="9"><span class="co">#' @param linenames_labels_size, Default: 2.5</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parameter ‘interactive’ gives possibility of seeing interactive version of plot. But remember, this is html vidget and it will not take into account parameters like ‘title’ or ‘data_source’.</p>
