# visR <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="131.5" />

The goal of visR is to enable fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible defaults and based on sound [graphical principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/).

[Package documentation](https://openpharma.github.io/visR/)

## Motivation

By using a common package for visualising data analysis results in the clinical development process, we want to have a **positive influence** on 

* **choice of visualisation** by making it easy explore different visualisation and to use impactful visualisations fit-for-purpose
* effective visual communication by making it easy to **implement best practices** 

We are not judging on what visualisation you chose for your research question, but want facilitate and support good practice.

You can read more about the philosophy and architecture in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/openpharma/visR/wiki).

## Lifecycle and status

The package is still experimental and under active development with a current focus on developing a stable API.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("openpharma/visR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example to demonstrate how to plot using the api a time to event analysis. 


```{r example, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(visR)
library(survival)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr) 
library(ggplot2)

adtte %>%
  vr_KM_est(strata = "TRTP", conf.int = 0.90) %>%
  vr_plot(legend_position = "right", x_unit = "Days") %>%
  add_CI(alpha = 0.2,
         style = "ribbon",
         linetype = 3) %>%
  add_CNSR(shape = 3, size = 1) %>%
  add_risktable(
    min_at_risk = 0,
    statlist = c("n.risk", "n.event", "n.censor"),
    label = c("At risk", "Event", "Censor"),
    collapse = F
  )
```
